CONTEXT:
- Project: hershpateldotcom
- Goal: Add password-protected admin route at /shh
- Deployment: Vercel
- Framework: Next.js

ARCHITECTURE DECISION:
- Using stateless session-based auth with encrypted cookies
- No additional infrastructure needed
- Session management through HTTP-only cookies
- Edge middleware for protection
- No username, just password

COMPLETED TASKS:
1. Basic Admin Page Setup
- Created `/shh` route with basic structure
- Added blank page without SEO exposure

2. Login UI Implementation
- Created `/shh/login` with password form
- Added loading states and error handling
- Implemented client-side validation
- Added accessibility features

3. Auth Types & Utils Setup
- Added bcryptjs for password hashing
- Created types for session data, cookies, API responses
- Implemented utility functions for auth operations

4. Auth API Implementation
- Created login endpoint at `/api/auth/shh`
- Added rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 min)
- Implemented password verification
- Added session cookie management

5. Login UI Integration
- Connected form to auth API
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Implemented loading states
- Added return URL handling

6. Middleware Implementation
- Created middleware for `/shh/*` routes
- Added session validation
- Implemented secure redirects
- Added security headers

7. Enhanced Security
- Implemented JWT session management
- Added proper cookie security flags
- Enhanced middleware security
- Fixed environment variable handling

8. Production Readiness
✅ Error Boundaries
- Added ErrorBoundary component in `/shh/_components`
- Wrapped all admin routes in error boundary
- Added error recovery UI
- Implemented error logging

✅ Enhanced Logging
- Added structured logging in auth endpoints
- Included timing information
- Added IP tracking for security
- Improved error context in logs

✅ Security Audit Complete
- Protected routes verified
- Session management secured
- Security headers confirmed
- Error handling validated

CURRENT STATE:
- Full authentication flow working
- Error boundaries protecting UI
- Comprehensive logging in place
- Security measures implemented

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES NEEDED:
- SHH_PASSWORD_HASH: Bcrypt hash of admin password
- SHH_SESSION_SECRET: Random secure string for JWT signing
- SHH_SESSION_DURATION: Session length in seconds (optional, 24h default)

SECURITY FEATURES:
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- JWT session management
- Secure cookie settings
- Security headers in middleware
- Error boundaries for UI protection
- Enhanced logging for security monitoring
- IP-based tracking for security events

USER FLOW:
1. User visits `/shh` → redirected to `/shh/login` if no session
2. Enters password → verified against bcrypt hash
3. On success → redirected to `/shh` with session
4. On failure → shown appropriate error message
5. Logout → session cleared, redirected to login
